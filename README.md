# TA.Gist
TA.Gist presents your GitHub gists beautifully // an ultra-light PHP framework

This is a sample raw text gist - http://tebel.sg/gist/contact_virtual_reality 

# Why This
If you don't want to spend your life fiddling with themes and plugins just to post something. If you want to have control over layout and styling. If you are the kind of person who, for whatever reason, rather store your content on GitHub.

# To Setup
1. Extract folders and files to your website root directory
2. Configure /gist/index.php to your domain name and GitHub User ID
Includes setup comments in uppercase for your action, general comments in lowercase

# How It Works
