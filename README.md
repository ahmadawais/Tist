This is a sample raw text gist - http://tebel.sg/gist/contact_virtual_reality 

# Why This
If you don't want to spend your life fiddling with themes and plugins just to post something. If you want to have control over layout and styling. If you are the kind of person who, for whatever reason, rather store your content on GitHub.

# To Setup
Setup comments in uppercase for your action, general comments in lowercase
