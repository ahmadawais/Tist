# TA.Gist
TA.Gist presents your GitHub gists beautifully // an ultra-light PHP framework

This is a sample raw text gist - http://tebel.sg/gist/contact_virtual_reality 

# Why This
If you don't want to spend your life fiddling with themes and plugins just to post something. If you want to have control over layout and styling. If you are the kind of person who, for whatever reason, rather store your content on GitHub.

# Setup
1. Upload the folders and files to your website root directory
2. Setup /gist/index.php to your domain name and GitHub User ID

/gist/index.php includes setup comments in uppercase for your action, and general comments in lowercase.

# Using It
1. Create a gist in your GitHub account and save as raw text without extension
2. Pick a name for your gist and add a line in /gist/index.php for your new gist
3. Save a 1440 x 480 .jpeg image to /media folder using same name as your gist
4. TA.Gist presents your gist as a single page with header image and custom styling
5. Access your beautiful gist at your_website_domain_name/gist/name_of_your_gist
