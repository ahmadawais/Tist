This is a sample raw text gist - http://tebel.sg/gist/contact_virtual_reality

# Why This
If you don't want to spend your life fiddling with themes and plugins just to post something. If you want to have control over layout and styling. If you are the kind of person who, for whatever reason, rather store your content on GitHub.

# Set Up
1. Upload the folders and files to your website root directory
2. Point /gist/index.php to your website URL and GitHub User ID

Make sure /gist/.htaccess is uploaded to map friendly gist URLs

# To Use
1. Create a gist in your GitHub account and save as raw text without extension
2. Pick a name for your gist and add a line in /gist/index.php for your new gist
3. Save a 1440 x 480 .jpeg image to /media folder using same name as your gist

Access your beautiful gist at your_website_url/gist/your_gist_name
